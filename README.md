Version 1 of CryptoCharity Blockchain Project

Kind of uses contract in this repo (https://github.com/Blockchain-Group-2/CrypChar-Smart-Contract), which is the same that Version 0 depended on. The difference is that the same contract is deployed through web3.py

web3.py is more flexible than Truffle regarding the contract code. The deployment through web3 is also faster
