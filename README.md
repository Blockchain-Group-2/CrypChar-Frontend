Version 0 of CryptoCharity Blockchain Project

Uses contract in this repo (https://github.com/Blockchain-Group-2/CrypChar-Smart-Contract) that is deployed through Truffle
Truffle is strangely strict about what must be in your contract, namely the function headers

The CryptoCharity web app at https://crypchar.herokuapp.com/ is no longer connected to this v0 branch because this branch strangely stopped working. Our group got it working and demonstrated it in a club meeting, but then we left it for a few weeks and it stopped working. I saw strange balances, so perhaps unusual transactions did something to the app. Nevertheless, we should've had working code.
